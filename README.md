# Bubba's World Game Dev
Learning to use Godot 4 to make video games (with blender for modelling/texturing/animation). This serves as a development repo for a game about my friend's hamster Bubba, being built as I learn.

Currently, the aim is to walk around the world collecting peanuts. More functionality will be added as I learn how to do it.
All music and sound effects are original recordings (so far). Most 3D models have been procured from free CAD websites.


## TODO:
- Add jump sound
- Make proper levels
- Add human hand (model downloaded -  see here for details on rig animation etc: [Rigged Hand Models Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcUO1tmnUaU)
- Learn how to build the rest of the game...
