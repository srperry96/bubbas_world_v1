# Bubba's World (Hamster Simulator) Game
Learning to use Godot 4 to make video games (with blender for modelling/texturing/animation). This serves as a development repo for a game about my friend's hamster Bubba, being built as I learn.

Currently, the aim is to walk around the world collecting peanuts. More functionality will be added as I learn how to do it.
All music and sound effects are original recordings (so far). Most 3D models have been procured from free CAD websites.
